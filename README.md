== README

Basically, this is a project to accompany the jasny-bundle gem that I have created. The project Gemfile has the jasny_bundle gem linked in, just run 'bundle install' and you will have everything you need to get this template running on rails. It is a bare-bones framework with some example links in the navigation. 

I hope you find this template useful and if you think you can improve on this, then please do annd submit a pull request.
